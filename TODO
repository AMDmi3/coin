Todo
====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/inttypes.h.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/kosher.h. (Needs to
  try compiling under g++ and SGI CC to check that we've covered the
  functionality provided.)

* [mortene:19990912] add options in configure for compiling slimmed
  versions of Coin (--without-coin-engines etc). Or perhaps make a
  single --compile-basesystem option instead?

* [mortene:19990913] move tasklist from docs/todo.txt into this file.

* [mortene:19990913] write non-generic instructions in the INSTALL
  file.

* [mortene:19990913] write a file ``HACKING'' with tips & tricks for
  faster turn-around when doing development.

* [mortene:19990913] integrate the doxygen man- and html-generation
  into "make install".

* [mortene:19990916] improve the autoconf macro which checks for
  Mesa/OpenGL (read the FIXME's in configure.in just above where it's
  in use).

* [mortene:19990916] make ``install'' avoid re-installing header files
  which has not been modified (and other untouched files, for that
  matter).

* [mortene:19990914] check possibility of making all .o/.lo files (or
  only the .la files?) into .so shared libraries to avoid long linking
  times (could be a brilliant hack if it is possible)

* [mortene:19990917] clean up the .h-files before installation. Remove
  "//$ BEGIN TEMPLATE" and "//$ END TEMPLATE". Remove
  "#if.*(COIN_EXCLUDE_.*)" blocks?

  srcdir, so the .cvsignore file(s) can be constructed and submitted.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] make version settings in
  SbBasic.h automatically follow the definitions made in configure.in.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] include check in configure.in
  for simage.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] use simage define setting to
