TODO:
=====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** RENDERING ITEMS ***

* [mortene:1999????] add support for rendering 3D text, as used by
  SoText3 and other node types.

* [mortene:1999????] make a library with the necessary functionality
  for doing nurbs curves and nurbs surfaces. Could perhaps start off
  with the code in Brian Paul's MIT-relicensed Mesa (if MesaGLU is
  part of that)?

* [mortene:1999????] support the SoRenderList and SoOctTreeOrdering
  stuff. Should at least provide a dummy implementation.


*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991113] is it possible to get the make process to print
  out which dependency causes recompilation of a file? That would be a
  nice feature.

* [mortene:19991108] it looks like the header files are copied twice
  upon ``make install'', so the hack in the Makefile.am files to work
  around an Automake bug should be improved a bit.. or perhaps we
  could just as well wait for the next Automake release, and remove
  the hack altogether?

* [mortene:19991107] example programs and tools shouldn't be compiled
  with the __SOLIB_INTERNAL__ define set.

* [mortene:19990926] add configure option to enable crash (and
  subsequent core dump, of course) on SoDebugError::postWarning() and
  SoDebugError::post().

* [mortene:19990926] add configure option for specifying location of
  simage.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/inttypes.h. Check to
  see if we can use the AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF macro from the
  autoconf macro archive to find and define types for 8/16/32/64 bits.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/kosher.h, replace with
  autoconf checks. (Needs to try compiling under g++ and SGI CC to
  check that we've covered the functionality provided.)

* [mortene:19990924] clean up the configure.in file a bit by making
  macros SIM_ARG_WITH_BOOL, SIM_ARG_WITHOUT_BOOL, SIM_ARG_ENABLE_BOOL
  and SIM_ARG_DISABLE_BOOL?

* [mortene:19990912] add options in configure for compiling slimmed
  versions of Coin (--without-coin-engines etc). Or perhaps make a
  single --compile-basesystem option instead?

* [mortene:19990913] integrate the doxygen man- and html-generation
  into "make install".

* [mortene:19990916] make ``make install'' avoid re-installing header
  files which has not been modified (and other untouched files, for
  that matter).

* [mortene:19990917] clean up the .h-files before installation: remove
  "//$ BEGIN TEMPLATE" and "//$ END TEMPLATE". Remove
  "#if.*(COIN_EXCLUDE_.*)" blocks? Remove stuff between
  __SOLIB_INTERNAL__.

* [mortene:1999????] make Coin build under MSWindows with the Cygwin
  tools.

* [mortene:19991127] use the PETI_WITH_DMALLOC macro from the autoconf
  macro archives to optionally make with dmalloc
  (<http://www.dmalloc.com>).

*** GENERIC ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991130] names containing (note: not only "beginning
  with") __ (double underscore) or beginning with _[A-Z] (single
  underscore immediately followed by an uppercase letter) are reserved
  in C++ for the implementation. All header file "wrapper definitions"
  must be rewritten, and the __SOLIB_INTERNAL__ define must be
  changed.

* [mortene:19991128] code restructuring: convert internal use of lists
  to SbList wherever possible.

* [mortene:19991124] write documentation for the tools (ivcat,
  ivhierarchy, ...)

* [kintel:19990928] test and fix problems with running on 64-bit
  platforms.

* [mortene:1999????] Use float-versions of math-functions on platforms
  where they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc instead of cos(),
  sqrt(), ..). Use autoconf for testing availability.

* [mortene:1999????] Make a better dict class than SbDict. Something
  based on templates?

* [mortene:19990930] SbString.h is incompatible with the std::string
  STL definition? Look into this to see if it can be solved. (Reported
  by Jason Fritz on coin-devsupport.)


*** SUPPORT ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991115] move WWW pages from public_www module into Coin
  module and set up necessary mechanism on www.sim.no to extract and
  publish pages automatically.

* [mortene:19990807] make an overview list on the Coin WWW pages of
  what's implemented and what's not -- separate list into "vs OI 2.1"
  and "vs OI 2.5".

* [mortene:19991009] autogenerate Doxygen html documentation and
  publish on our Coin www pages.

* [mortene:19991016] convert documentation of functions to Doxygen's
  \param + \return format (this is a _huge_ and boring job, but it can
  be done gradually, of course).

* [mortene:19990913] move tasklist from docs/todo.txt into this file.

* [mortene:19990913] write non-generic instructions in the INSTALL
  file.

* [mortene:19990913] write a file ``HACKING'' with tips & tricks for
  faster turn-around when doing development.

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date][implementer:finished-date] item")

*** RENDERING ITEMS ***



*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19990926][mortene:19991205] fix code which generates
  warnings when configured with --disable-debug.

* [mortene:19991124][mortene:19991126] install the binaries under the
  tools/ directory in $prefix/bin.
        
* [mortene:19990916][mortene:19991030] improve the autoconf macro
  which checks for Mesa/OpenGL (read the FIXME's in configure.in just
  above where it's in use). NB: this macro is _completely_ and
  _utterly_ foobar! We're probably better off writing our own
  macro(s). ==> Didn't bother to make a new macro, as the OpenGL/Mesa
  checks aren't too complex (not much different from searching for any
  other link library).

* [mortene:19990926][mortene:19990926] add "testlib" idea from DDJ to
  increase turnaround time when doing compile & link.

* [mortene:19990924][mortene:19990926] check for simage in the
  --prefix installation directory.

* [mortene:19990914][mortene:19990926] check possibility of making all
  .o/.lo files (or only the .la files?) into .so shared libraries to
  avoid long linking times (could be a brilliant hack if it is
  possible)

* [mortene:19990924][mortene:19990924] default to compile without RTTI
  and exceptions for g++/egcs?

* [mortene:19990918][mortene:19990918] use the GL_CFLAGS and GL_LIBS
  from the OpenGL detection macro.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990916] add configure options for
  turning compilation with profiling information on or off.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990916] add configure options for
  turning compilation with all compiler warnings on or off.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990915] include check in configure.in
  for OpenGL/Mesa.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] add configure option for doing
  compilation without any symbols included in the object files.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] add configure option for
  turning compilation with all debug information on or off.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] avoid having
  include/Inventor/SbBasic.h being regenerated if it would be
  identical to the file already present.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] remove multiple -lsimage on the
  final libCoin link line.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] ``make'' package within the
  srcdir, so the .cvsignore file(s) can be constructed and submitted.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] make version settings in
  SbBasic.h automatically follow the definitions made in configure.in.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] include check in configure.in
  for simage.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] use simage define setting to
  include/exclude use of functionality possibly provided by the simage
  library.



*** GENERIC ITEMS ***



*** SUPPORT ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19991110][mortene:19991115] pipe commit messages from CVS
  to a coin-cvs mailing list.

* [mortene:19990807][mortene:19991009] fix up the autogeneration of
  Metadon-pages.
