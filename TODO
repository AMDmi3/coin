TODO:
=====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date] item", listed in no particular order)

*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19990926] add configure option to enable crash (and
  subsequent core dump, of course) on SoDebugError::postWarning() and
  SoDebugError::post().

* [mortene:19990926] add configure option for specifying location of
  simage.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/inttypes.h.

* [mortene:19990912] get rid of Inventor/system/kosher.h. (Needs to
  try compiling under g++ and SGI CC to check that we've covered the
  functionality provided.)

* [mortene:19990924] clean up the configure.in file a bit by making
  macros SIM_ARG_WITH_BOOL, SIM_ARG_WITHOUT_BOOL, SIM_ARG_ENABLE_BOOL
  and SIM_ARG_DISABLE_BOOL.

* [mortene:19990912] add options in configure for compiling slimmed
  versions of Coin (--without-coin-engines etc). Or perhaps make a
  single --compile-basesystem option instead?

* [mortene:19990913] move tasklist from docs/todo.txt into this file.

* [mortene:19990913] write non-generic instructions in the INSTALL
  file.

* [mortene:19990913] write a file ``HACKING'' with tips & tricks for
  faster turn-around when doing development.

* [mortene:19990913] integrate the doxygen man- and html-generation
  into "make install".

* [mortene:19990916] improve the autoconf macro which checks for
  Mesa/OpenGL (read the FIXME's in configure.in just above where it's
  in use). NB: this macro is _completely_ and _utterly_ foobar! We're
  probably better off writing our own macro(s).

* [mortene:19990916] make ``install'' avoid re-installing header files
  which has not been modified (and other untouched files, for that
  matter).

* [mortene:19990917] clean up the .h-files before installation. Remove
  "//$ BEGIN TEMPLATE" and "//$ END TEMPLATE". Remove
  "#if.*(COIN_EXCLUDE_.*)" blocks?

* [mortene:19990926] remove compiler warnings when configuring with
  --disable-debug.


*** GENERIC ITEMS ***

* [kintel:19990928] test and fix problems with running on 64-bit
  platforms.

* [mortene:1999????] Use float-versions of math-functions on platforms
  where they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc instead of cos(),
  sqrt(), ..). Use autoconf for testing availability.

* [mortene:1999????] Make a better dict class than SbDict. Something
  based on templates?

* [mortene:19990930] SbString.h is incompatible with the std::string
  STL definition? Look into this to see if it can be solved. (Reported
  by Jason Fritz on coin-devsupport.)

DONE:
=====

(format is: "* [author:conceived-date][implementer:finished-date] item")

*** BUILD ITEMS ***

* [mortene:19990926][mortene:19990926] add "testlib" idea from DDJ to
  increase turnaround time when doing compile & link.

* [mortene:19990924][mortene:19990926] check for simage in the
  --prefix installation directory.

* [mortene:19990914][mortene:19990926] check possibility of making all
  .o/.lo files (or only the .la files?) into .so shared libraries to
  avoid long linking times (could be a brilliant hack if it is
  possible)

* [mortene:19990924][mortene:19990924] default to compile without RTTI
  and exceptions for g++/egcs?

* [mortene:19990918][mortene:19990918] use the GL_CFLAGS and GL_LIBS
  from the OpenGL detection macro.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990916] add configure options for
  turning compilation with profiling information on or off.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990916] add configure options for
  turning compilation with all compiler warnings on or off.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990915] include check in configure.in
  for OpenGL/Mesa.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] add configure option for doing
  compilation without any symbols included in the object files.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] add configure option for
  turning compilation with all debug information on or off.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] avoid having
  include/Inventor/SbBasic.h being regenerated if it would be
  identical to the file already present.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] remove multiple -lsimage on the
  final libCoin link line.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] ``make'' package within the
  srcdir, so the .cvsignore file(s) can be constructed and submitted.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] make version settings in
  SbBasic.h automatically follow the definitions made in configure.in.

* [mortene:19990912][mortene:19990913] include check in configure.in
  for simage.

* [mortene:19990913][mortene:19990913] use simage define setting to
  include/exclude use of functionality possibly provided by the simage
  library.
