This file contains a list of semi-large tasks which needs to be done
with simage, SoQt and Coin. The items are roughly categorized in
these categories:

* Build: tasks for improving the build process of the components in
  the Coin project.

* Rendering: making improvements to or adding rendering functionality.

* SoQt: tasks related to the Qt interface components.

* VRML: tasks related to implementing the support necessary for
  handling VRML1 and VRML2/VRML97 files and structures.

* Module: add missing "modules" or missing features in modules to
  Coin.

* Network: tasks in the vein of making Coin "network-friendly".

* Generic: general improvements to the sourcecode.

* Misc: other items which are hard to categorize.


******************************************************************************

000. (Rendering) Add support for rendering 3D text, as used by SoText3
     and other node types.

001. (Rendering) Implement caching.

002. (Modules) Implement nodekit support.

003. (Modules) Implement SoPickAction and SoRayPickAction to make Coin
     ready for interaction code.

004. (Modules) Complete the implementation of projectors. Much of the
     base code has been made through the SbSphereSheetProjector
     implementation.

005. (Modules) Implement draggers. Depends on nodekits and picking
     being available.

006. (Modules) Implement manipulators. Depends on draggers.

007. (Modules) Complete the implementation of sensors. Its nearly
     there.

008. (Build) Convert simage build to an autoconf-based process.

009. (Build) Make simage build under MSWindows.

010. (Build) Convert SoQt build to an autoconf-based process.

011. (Build) Make SoQt build under MSWindows.

012. (Build) Convert Coin build to an autoconf-based process.

013. (Build) Make Coin build under MSWindows.

014. (Generic) Use float-versions of math-functions on platforms where
     they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc instead of cos(),
     sqrt(), ..). This would probably best be done after the autoconf
     build-process is in place.

015. (Generic) Make a better dict class than SbDict. Something based
     on templates.

016. (VRML) Add VRML2 classes.

017. (VRML) VRML2 import/export.

018. (VRML) VRML1 import/export.

019. (VRML) VRML1 upgraders.

020. (SoQt) Implement editors (materialeditor, lighteditor).

021. (SoQt) Implement missing viewers (flyviewer, planeviewer,
     walkviewer, collisionviewer).

022. (SoQt) Added misc small components of minor importance.

023. (SoQt) Add misc stuff missing from the implemented components and
     viewers (overplay planes under X11, large model visualization
     stuff).

024. (SoQt) Port pederb's VRML viewer framework from QvLib/RR to
     Coin/SoQt.

025. (Modules) Make code in the node classes be aware of the override
     flag. Necessary to get the mechanism in the viewers for using
     different rendering styles (hidden line, without textures, etc)
     work correctly.

026. (Modules) Set up the macros which make it easy to extend Coin (in
     SoSubNode, SoSubEngine, SoSubField, etc).

027. (Network) Port urlget features to Curl.

028. (Network) Interface relevant parts of Coin to Curl (SoWWWAnchor,
     SoWWWInline, texture import, misc VRML support).

029. (Rendering) Make a library with the necessary functionality for
     doing nurbs curves and nurbs surfaces. Could perhaps start off
     with the code in Brian Paul's MIT-relicensed Mesa (if MesaGLU is
     part of that)?

030. (Rendering) Support the SoRenderList node. Should at least
     provide a dummy implementation.

031. (Misc) Implement the various parts of Large Model Visualization.
