This file contains a list of semi-large tasks which needs to be done
with simage, SoQt and Coin. The items are roughly categorized in
these categories:

* Build: tasks for improving the build process of the components in
  the Coin project.

* Rendering: making improvements to or adding rendering functionality.

* SoQt: tasks related to the Qt interface components.

* VRML: tasks related to implementing the support necessary for
  handling VRML1 and VRML2/VRML97 files and structures.

* Module: add missing "modules" or missing features in modules to
  Coin.

* Network: tasks in the vein of making Coin "network-friendly".

* Generic: general improvements to the sourcecode.

* Support: tasks not directly related to the Coin source, but to the
  development process or whatever else.

* Misc: other items which are hard to categorize.


******************************************************************************

000. (Rendering) [1999????] Add support for rendering 3D text, as used
     by SoText3 and other node types.

001. (Rendering) [1999????] Implement caching.

002. (Modules) [1999????] Implement nodekit support.

003. (Modules) [1999????] Implement SoPickAction and SoRayPickAction
     to make Coin ready for interaction code.

004. (Modules) [1999????] Complete the implementation of
     projectors. Much of the base code has been made through the
     SbSphereSheetProjector implementation.

005. (Modules) [1999????] Implement draggers. Depends on nodekits and
     picking being available.

006. (Modules) [1999????] Implement manipulators. Depends on draggers.

007. (Modules) [1999????] Complete the implementation of sensors. Its
     nearly there.

008. (Build) [1999????] Convert simage build to an autoconf-based
     process.

009. (Build) [1999????] Make simage build under MSWindows.

010. (Build) [1999????] Convert SoQt build to an autoconf-based
     process.

011. (Build) [1999????] Make SoQt build under MSWindows.

012. (Build) [1999????] Convert Coin build to an autoconf-based
     process.

013. (Build) [1999????] Make Coin build under MSWindows.

014. (Generic) [1999????] Use float-versions of math-functions on
     platforms where they are supported (i.e. fcos(), fsqrt() etc
     instead of cos(), sqrt(), ..). This would probably best be done
     after the autoconf build-process is in place.

015. (Generic) [1999????] Make a better dict class than
     SbDict. Something based on templates.

016. (VRML) [1999????] Add VRML2 classes.

017. (VRML) [1999????] VRML2 import/export.

018. (VRML) [1999????] VRML1 import/export.

019. (VRML) [1999????] VRML1 upgraders.

020. (SoQt) [1999????] Implement editors (materialeditor,
     lighteditor).

021. (SoQt) [1999????] Implement missing viewers (flyviewer,
     planeviewer, walkviewer, collisionviewer).

022. (SoQt) [1999????] Add misc small components of minor importance
     to complete the library.

023. (SoQt) [1999????] Add misc stuff missing from the implemented
     components and viewers (overplay planes under X11, large model
     visualization stuff).

024. (SoQt) [1999????] Port pederb's VRML viewer framework from
     QvLib/RR to Coin/SoQt.

025. (Modules) [1999????] Make code in the node classes be aware of
     the override flag. Necessary to get the mechanism in the viewers
     for using different rendering styles (hidden line, without
     textures, etc) work correctly.

026. (Modules) [1999????] Set up the macros which make it easy to
     extend Coin (in SoSubNode, SoSubEngine, SoSubField, etc).

027. (Network) [1999????] Port urlget features to Curl.

028. (Network) [1999????] Interface relevant parts of Coin to Curl
     (SoWWWAnchor, SoWWWInline, texture import, misc VRML support).

029. (Rendering) [1999????] Make a library with the necessary
     functionality for doing nurbs curves and nurbs surfaces. Could
     perhaps start off with the code in Brian Paul's MIT-relicensed
     Mesa (if MesaGLU is part of that)?

030. (Rendering) [1999????] Support the SoRenderList node. Should at
     least provide a dummy implementation.

031. (Misc) [1999????] Implement the various parts of Large Model
     Visualization.

032. (Support) [19990807] Fix up the autogeneration of Metadon-pages.

033. (Support) [19990807] Make an overview list on the Coin WWW pages
     of what's implemented and what's not -- separate list into "vs OI
     2.1" and "vs OI 2.5".
